## Description  
A MERN stack app that allows users to find their lost pets by creating reports that others can respond to and update.  It offers a user a dashboard where they can see all their posts, as well as those of other users of the site.  Allowing users to crowd source real-time from neighbors who have otherwise been strangers, the app helps families reunite and helps communities come together when there is a vital need quickly and efficiently.
